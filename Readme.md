# Text Classification using Naive Bayes
A Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is implemented with two
different feature selection criteria for text document classification.
In the first part, all words in the documents set as features whereas features are selected with Mutual Information in the second part. Dataset is Reuters-21578 which contains 21578 news stories from Reuters newswire classified under one or more of 118 categories. 
The Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier assings a document into one of the following classes:
1. earn
2. acq
3. money-fx
4. grain
5. crude

How to run the code: </br>
python3 text_classification.py </br>

After running the program, there will be two options: </br>
1) Naive Bayes
2) Naive Bayes with Mutual Information
